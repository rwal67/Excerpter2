Every single alteration made to it, those same material accomplishments we cling to as evidence of the total goal of life- namely the propagation of the species without rhyme or reason, that we create our own reason- all of these feats are birthed in mind, as ideas that we happened to cling to long enough to bring them to fruition.",

           "the room with the floral wallpaper and cool white light bulbs fastened in pre-war lamps, the room with the storied ciselé red velvet armchair and the indolence of aerosolized Fresh Hawaiian.",
           "May I raise that long ago, someone told a joke- like these, this joke was not particularly funny. Someone laughed, and it made the jester feel so good, so comforted. More joined in, and they too felt good, and a chorus of jubilation erupts in the local vicinity, and now you have a giggling, silly mass of people keeling over, eyes welling up, their sides hurting. From that moment onwards, nobody remembered the joke- but feared the cold reality of silence too much to escape the comfortable confines of the rancor. Wouldn't that be funny?",
           "A woman, this time in a beige-ish-gray hat, full-brimmed, gets aboard, and, looking for a seat, assumes the now vacant red-hatted man's.",
           "I have found they laugh. It was only through such silence where no laughter could be found that my ears were primed to understand this.",
           "They will laugh and laugh, and lose sight of what it is they are laughing about; they are like flames being passed from candle to candle, if one were to go out, all that would be needed is one more to relight the others.",
           "A striking chord, like a single plucking of a heavenly harp",
           "I chase its sound in everything.",
           "With this, the whole group will burst out into a strangely sustained laughter, and they are not mere chuckles",
           "nor are there any “and then somes” to be added; it is a sharp, pronounced laugh for any passerby to be subject to.",
           "Only wishing to say, as a call to action, that you are the very wardens of the jail you are kept in!",
           "'You know- I've been thinking a lot lately. See those half-moons that hang under my eyes? I rest my case.'",
           "He drew two sevens and a king",
           "subjecting the poker table to his improv treatise on the divine right of kings before tearing the head off it, making sure everyone was watching",
           "'It's been on my mind; that moment when we first hit flame- lightning struck some shrubbery and in that flaming bush we saw God, then realizing we could strike out on our own? You were there, right? Well, maybe in that moment, like a flash in the pan: the scaffolding was laid to the Hagia Sofia, and then the Chrysler Building; Hokusai laid the last brush stroke on the Great Wave; Napolean hung his head in defeat at Waterloo; and the Plutonium fissioned and Fat Man went off. Maybe there were a few moments in delay between them, but overall, it was just like that. Just in that instant.'",
